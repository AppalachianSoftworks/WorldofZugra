<!-- This file will be linked to by a button in the game's Inn at any town.

<h1>Welcome to the Zugra petshop</h1><br>
<h4>A place where adorable pets can be adopted by the heros and adventurers in Zugra. A pet will be a fabulous companion to keep you company and will help you in epic battles when you decide to bite off a bit more than you are capable of masticating.</h4><br>

<!-- What other information could be contained on this page? Imagine it as a pet shop, Can we fill it with caged beasts and a NPC that seems to appreciate the company of beasts as opposed to humanoids? Rudimentary run on a MVP so a lot of work is needed here obviously-->
