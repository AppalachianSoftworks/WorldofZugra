<!-- Okay what we are looking for here is a form that would give the option of adopting a pet
the pets possible will be displayed as they are organized in folders based on the character's sex and race
images/pets/$charactersex/$characterrace/option1 ... optionx etc. 
There could be a cost associated with adoption perhaps option1 costs low and optionx costs high
upon submit subtract cost from characters gold inventory and place an entry for the pet into that characters database.
Also on this form the naming of the pet should be handled by an input field presented to the player
Obviously this is starting from scratch which I keep saying on here because I only just began using github for these purposes
More to come-->
